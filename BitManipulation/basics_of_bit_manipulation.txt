1s compliment --> flip all the bits
2s compliment --> take 1s compliment and add 1 to it

AND
all true = true
one false = false

OR
one true = true
all false = false

XOR
no of 1s odd == 1
no of 1s even = 0


Shift Operators

right shift Operators

x == 13 >> 1
this is said as 13 right shifted by 1

1 1 0 1 ==> 13
after right shift 1
0 1 1 0 ==> 6

so the answer we basically got was 13/2 = 6 (considering the floor value)

left shift Operators

left shift k = (num) X 2power(k)


the computer will always store the negative number as the number's 2s compliment

so if we have ~(-6)

first we will take the 2s compliment of 6 and then do the NOT gate (flip the bits)
